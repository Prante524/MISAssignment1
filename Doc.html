    <p>Grameenphone LTD, widely abbreviated as (d/b/a) GP, is a telecommunications service provider in Bangladesh. As of December 2023, its subscribers span over 82.20 million.[4] It is a joint venture between Telenor and Grameen Telecom. Where Telenor owns a 55.8% share of Grameenphone, Grameen Telecom owns 34.2% and the remaining 10% is publicly held.[5] As of Nov 2024, Grammenphone is Bangladesh's most valuable company with a market cap of more than à§³440.2 billion BDT or $3.6 billion USD (approximately).[6]<br>
    <br>
    <p>Grameenphone was the first company to introduce GSM technology over 900 and 1800 MHz in Bangladesh.[7] It was also the first company to introduce 5G network in the country, for which the first test was done in Dhaka and Chittagong metropolitan area in mid-2022. In September 2022, Grameenphone successfully conducted trials for the second time in Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal, Mymensingh and Rangpur cities.[8] Grameenphone is the only company to offer ESIM technology in Bangladesh. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Founder Muhammad Yunus founded Grameenphone to provide universal mobile phone access throughout Bangladesh, including its rural areas.[9][10] He was inspired by the Grameen Bank micro-credit model and envisioned a business model where a cell phone can serve as a source of income. After leaving his job as an investment banker in the United States, Quadir met and successfully raised money from New York-based investor and philanthropist Joshua Mailman. He then returned to Bangladesh and worked for three years to gain support from organizations such as Grameen Bank and the Norwegian telecom company, Telenor.[11]</p>
